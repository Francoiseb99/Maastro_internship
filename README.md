# Maastro_internship

This GitHub page contains all relevant code for working with the Azure Kinect DK created during my internship at Maastro. Some parts of the code are based on the demos from Juan R. Terven (jrterven@hotmail.com) & Diana M. Cordova (diana_mce@hotmail.com), since they wrote code to be used in MATLAB opposed to the C++ which is the actual language to be used for the Azure Kinect DK. However, some installations are needed to use this code and therefore a manual / logbook like document is also included. This document not only contains steps for the installation, but also more information on the Azure Kinect DK and the work done durring this internship. For a more formal view of the work done during this internship, see the report which is also present on this page. 

If anything on this page, in the code or in either of the documents is unclear or if there are any questions or conmments, please feel free to contact me:
