# Maastro_internship

This GitHub page contains all relevant code for working with the Azure Kinect created during my internship at Maastro. Some parts of the code are based on the demos from Juan R. Terven (jrterven@hotmail.com) & Diana M. Cordova (diana_mce@hotmail.com), since they wrote code to be used in MATLAB opposed to the C++ which is the actual language to be used for the Azure Kinect. However, some installations are needed to use this code and therefore a manual / logbook like document is also included. This document not only contains steps for the installation, but also more information on the Azure Kinect and the work done durring this internship. For a more formal view of the work done during this internship, see the report which is also present on this page. 

Note that most of the code are functions including variables and a section with extra options inside the function to make it more generable applicable. Howerver, some of the code may be a bit more hardcoded, this mostly concerns the codes used for processing of the data like e.g. the ExtractData function.

If anything on this page, in the code or in either of the documents is unclear or if there are any questions or conmments, please feel free to contact me:
